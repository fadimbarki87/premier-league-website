# Premier League Question Answering Website

This repository contains a minimal static frontend for the Premier League Question Answering Agent.
It provides a simple web interface to interact with the backend API.

The website is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted using GitHub Pages.

- `style.css` handles layout and styling
